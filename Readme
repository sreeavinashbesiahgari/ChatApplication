The pthread library is employed in the following applications:

Using pthread_create(), two threads are generated in the ChatClient::handle_messenger_() method. One thread receives messages from the server, while the other thread sends messages to the server. The receive_wrapper() function and the ChatClient::send() method are used to construct these threads.
In the ChatClient::handle_messenger_() method, the pthread_attr_t structure is used to set thread properties such as the thread's detach state.
In the ChatClient::handle_messenger_() method, the pthread_join() function is used to wait for the threads generated with pthread_create() to terminate.

select() is used to monitor file descriptors for I/O events.
In this code, select() is used to wait for messages to be received from the server on the client's socket file descriptor (cfd).The select() function takes five arguments:max_fd+1: the highest file descriptor in the set plus one.
readmessages_fds: a pointer to a set of file descriptors to be monitored for incoming data to be read.
The return value of select() is the number of file descriptors that are ready for I/O, or -1 on error.
